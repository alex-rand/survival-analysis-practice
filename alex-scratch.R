# posterior_survfit() to generate all the curves we need
# also just plot() though I think.
# fixef() and ranef() for ease of access to parameter estimates
# log_lik gives us the LPPD
# waic and loo both work :)
# ps_check() to plot the survival function against th KM curve :)

### With splines we need to specify:
# spline degree Î´;
# knot locations k OR degrees of freedom DF. Degrees of freedom is just 'number of knots' I think. 

# There are always automatically two boundary knots that I can't change, 
# IE one at the first event time and one at the last time observed, be it
# an event or a censor. So all I can control are the _internal_ knots. 
# You can either specify the exact locations of all the internal knots,
# OR you can just say 'I want 5 internal knots' and then they'll be spaced
# evenly in terms of percentile across the curve. 



# You specify these by making them a list and passing them to the basehaz_ops.

# for example:

# basehaz_ops = list(degree = 2, knots = c(10,20)) 

# would request a baseline hazard modelled using quadratic
# M-splines with two internal knots located at t = 10 and t = 20.
